# mpv-conf
My mpv configuration files. Really not advisable to use if not me, I have some strange configs in there. For example, all default keybinds are disabled and only very few are set in `input.conf`. Also mkv chapters are disabled as well, just to show a few strange examples in there.

Before using, review the conf files first, to know what's going on.
